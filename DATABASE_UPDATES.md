## 2025-08-15: Public RSVP Access Fix

### Issue
- Public RSVP pages showing "Wedding Not Found" in incognito mode
- RLS policies were blocking anonymous access to wedding details

### Solution Applied
```sql
-- Allow public access to view wedding details for RSVP pages
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to weddings for RSVP" ON weddings
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (true);
```

### Impact
- ✅ Public RSVP pages now work without authentication
- ✅ Anonymous users can view wedding details to submit RSVPs
- ✅ Security: Only read access granted, no insert/update/delete permissions
- ✅ Admin functionality still protected by existing user-specific policies

### Test URLs
- **Public RSVP**: http://localhost:5173/wedding/0739cc9c-5684-4a67-a90d-7cbc5eac6eed
- **Available Weddings**:
  - ID: `da9ef1a3-5511-4094-818f-c597d6ae176c` - "Testing123"
  - ID: `0739cc9c-5684-4a67-a90d-7cbc5eac6eed` - "Hamza Weddings"

### RLS Policies Now Active
1. **Admin Access**: `Users can view their own weddings` - Authenticated users see their weddings
2. **Public Access**: `Allow public read access to weddings for RSVP` - Anonymous users can view wedding details
3. **Insert/Update/Delete**: Still restricted to wedding owners only

This ensures proper security while enabling public RSVP functionality.
